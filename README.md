## 💻 Test-Driven Development - Bowling Game Kata 💻

What do I have to do?

💻 Following our session on breaking down problems via the Roman Numerals kata, we would like you to the Bowling Game Kata using Test-Driven Development.

---

🗒️ Instructions

👉 Read the Bowling Game Kata requirements. You can find it in the following link: https://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/

👉 Please note that the kata ‘clues’ section refers to some C# testing frameworks like XUnit, please ignore these - use the same coding template as you used for the Roman Numerals kata.

👉 Record yourself for solving this kata using TDD. Try to explain your thinking and take the listener on the journey you are on as you begin to solve the problem.

👉 Don’t worry if you don’t reach a full solution as this Kata is designed for you to practise test-driven development and understand the process. Feel free to continue and complete the kata afterwards outside of the recording for practice.

🔊 We would like you to talk through your thinking process on the recording while you're coding; think of it like a live commentary of your reasoning on 'why' and 'how' you're going about solving the Kata. This is a common ask during tech interviews.

💡Tips & Tricks on how to get started

❗Set up your Code Editor / IDE beforehand so you’re ready to write the unit tests and code.

Before you write your code, make sure you understand the problem statement. The Kata may seem large at first, so break it down into smaller, manageable pieces.

💭 Use the RED - GREEN - REFACTOR cycle: Write one failing test first and write the simplest code to make that test pass, then see if there is any opportunity to refactor. If not, move onto writing your next test and follow the cycle through as you build up your solution.

💭 Use the Triple A Structure - Arrange, Act, Assert to guide you when writing your unit tests

💭 Remember to consider a range of different happy path test cases (all types of valid inputs) and edge cases (all types of invalid/missing inputs).

💡If you like, apply PseudoCode to help you think through your logic

Pseudocode is a description of the steps for an algorithm and can be used to help you think through your logic.

💥 How do I make a submission? 💥

✅ Please submit a 📹 10 minute maximum screenshare recording in .mp4 format of yourself doing the Kata on your chosen Code Editor/IDE. You can record yourself on a single person Zoom meeting for the video aspect.

✅ You must talk through your thinking process on the recording while you're coding; think of it like a live commentary of your reasoning on 'why' and 'how' you're going about solving the Kata. This is a common ask during tech interviews. Make sure you start the video with your first failing test and project set up (to save time).

😊 Happy Coding!
